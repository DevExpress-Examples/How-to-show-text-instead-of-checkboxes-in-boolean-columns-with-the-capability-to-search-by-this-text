# How to show text instead of checkboxes in boolean columns with the capability to search by this text

This example demonstrates how to show the required text instead of checkboxes in column cells. To specify an editor for an individual property, use the GridEditor [Data Annotation Attribute](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/16863/mvvm-framework/data-annotation-attributes) for a corresponding data source field as follows:

```C#
using DevExpress.Mvvm.DataAnnotations;

//...
 
[GridEditor(TemplateKey = "TextEditSettingsTemplate")]
public bool IsChecked_Attribute { get; set; }
```

TemplateKey is the key of a corresponding template that you can put into your Window/UserControl's or application's resources. Note that GridControl will take  [Data Annotation Attributes](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/16863/mvvm-framework/data-annotation-attributes) into account when either the [**EnableSmartColumnsGeneration**](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Grid.DataControlBase.EnableSmartColumnsGeneration) or  [GridColumn.IsSmart](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Grid.ColumnBase.IsSmart) property is set to **True**.

  
If you do not have the opportunity to modify the data source's structure manually, you can use **MetadataLocator** as described in the [DevExpress MVVM Framework. Using DataAnnotation attributes and DevExpress Fluent API](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/wpf/archive/2014/03/31/devexpress-mvvm-framework-using-dataannotation-attributes-and-devexpress-fluent-api.aspx) blog post.  
  
The attached sample illustrates both these approaches with the GridEditor [Data Annotation Attribute](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/16863/mvvm-framework/data-annotation-attributes) and MetadataLocator.
